## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/rajnath01/personal-portfolio.git
   cd personal-portfolio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Deployment

This project is configured to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. When you push changes to the `main` branch, the workflow will:

1. Build the project
2. Deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch

To manually deploy:

```
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

## Troubleshooting

If images or assets aren't displaying correctly:
- Ensure all image paths are correct
- Add a `.nojekyll` file in the `public` directory to prevent GitHub Pages from ignoring files that start with an underscore
- Check that the `homepage` field in `package.json` is set correctly
